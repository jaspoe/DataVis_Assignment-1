# DataVis_Assignment-1
The Charts were created in java. I used the library JFreeCharts for the Chart creation.
The whole thing was written in Eclipse Neon.

The project can be found on github:

To be noted:
I did not figure out how to change the graph based on checkboxes.
So instead of the checkboxes i created 3 buttons (both, female, male).
The usability is the same now. With the addition that it's easier to handle imo.
